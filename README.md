# Chess
A two-player Chess simulator built on Processing 3's (processing.org) python mode.

All standard chess rules apply, thus you can only make "legal" moves (as in, moves that don't break chess rules).
If its white's turn to move, then if you hover over any white piece, that piece's legal moves will be displayed, and then if you click on the piece itself, you will be able to select the desired legal move to play. The same applies if its black's turn.

Once a move is made, the board is rotated 180 degrees, thus making it easier for two people to play.

Thanks!
